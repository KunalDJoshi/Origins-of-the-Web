<h2>Internet</h2>
</div>
<div id="int-p">
The Internet is a global network connecting millions of computers. A network is a group of two or more computer systems linked together. Internet is a network of networks
that uses TCP/IP to link devices worldwide. The internet is a network of global exchanges including private, public, business, academic and government networks connected 
by guided, wireless and fiber-optic technologies.

<div id="www">
<h2>World Wide Web</h2>
</div>
<div id="www-p">
The World Wide Web (WWW) also known as the Web is combination of all resources and users on the internet that are using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). Documents and 
web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), which may be interlinked by hypertext, and are accessible over the Internet. The resources on World Wide 
Web can be accessed by using software application called a web browser.
</div>
<div id="hypt">
<h2>Hypertext</h2>
</div>
<div id="hypt-p">
Hypertext is text which contains links known as hyperlinks to other texts that the reader can immediately access. The term was coined by Ted Nelson in the 1960s and is one 
of the key concepts of the World Wide Web, where Web pages are often written in the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML).  Apart from text, the term "hypertext" is also sometimes 
used to describe tables, images, and other presentational content formats with integrated hyperlinks.

<div id="mult">
<h2>Multimedia</h2>
</div>
<div id="mult-p">
As the name suggests, multimedia is the integration of multiple forms of media. This includes text, audio, images, animations, video and interactive content. Multimedia 
contrasts with media that use only primary computer displays such as text-only or traditional forms of printed or hand-produced material. Educational software that involves 
animations, sound, and text is called "multimedia software." CDs and DVDs are often considered to be "multimedia formats" since they can store a lot of data and most forms 
of multimedia require a lot of disk space.
</div>
<div id="cli">
<h2>CLI</h2>
</div>
<div id="cli-p">
A command line interface (CLI) is a text-based user interface (UI) used to view and manage computer files. It is a means of interacting with a computer program where the user 
(or client) issues commands to the program in the form of command lines. The program which handles the interface is called a command-line interpreter or command-line processor.
Before the mouse, users interacted with an operating system (OS) or application with a keyboard. Users typed commands in the command line interface to run tasks on a computer.
</div>
<div id="gui">
<h2>GUI</h2>
</div>
<div id="gui-p">
The graphical user interface (GUI) is a user interface that includes graphical elements, such as windows, icons and buttons. GUI was introduced in 1970s to distinguish graphical 
interfaces from text-based ones, such as command line interfaces(CLI). Today GUIs are used nearly in all digital interfaces. The first commercially available GUI, called "PARC," 
was developed by Xerox. In 1984, Apple launched GUI-based OS was included with the Macintosh.

<div id="hci">
<h2>HCI</h2>
</div>
<div id="hci-p">
Human-computer interaction (HCI) is a multidisciplinary field of study focusing on how people interact with computers and to what extent computers are or are not developed for 
successful interaction with human beings. One important factor about HCI is that different users form different conceptions or mental models about their interactions and have 
different ways of learning and keeping knowledge and skills. Also cultural and national differences plays important role in studying or designing HCI.

<div id="ftp">
<h2>FTP</h2>
</div>
<div id="ftp-p">
File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a standard Internet protocol for transmitting files between computers on the Internet over TCP/IP connections. FTP is a client-server protocol where
client will ask for a file and remote server will provide the requested file. Using FTP, a client can upload, download, delete, rename, move and copy files on a server. The first 
FTP client applications were command-line programs developed before operating systems had graphical user interfaces, and are still shipped with most Windows, Unix, and Linux operating 
systems.
</div>
<div id="ssh">
<h2>SSH</h2>
</div>
<div id="ssh-p">
Secure Shell or Secure Socket Shell (SSH) is cryptographic network protocol for operating network services securely over an unsecured network. Secure Shell provides strong authentication 
and encrypted data communications between two computers connecting over an open network such as the internet. Typically, SSH-based communications/processes work on a client/server architecture 
consisting of a client and server SSH. The client is securely authenticated and connected, and sends encrypted commands to be executed on the server. Both the client and server are authenticated 
using RSA public key cryptography based digital certificates.
</div>
<div id="http">
<h2>HTTP</h2>
</div>
<div id="http-p">
Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the protocol used to transfer data over the web. HTTP is the underlying  protocol used by the World Wide Web and defines commands and services used for 
transmitting webpage data. HTTP uses a server-client model. A client may be a home computer, laptop, or mobile device. The HTTP server is typically a web host running web server software, 
such as Apache or IIS. When you access a website, your browser sends a request to the corresponding web server and it responds with an HTTP status code. If the URL is valid and the 
connection is granted, the server will send your browser the webpage and related files.
</div>
<div id="telnet">
<h2>Telnet</h2>
</div>
<div id="telnet-p">
Telnet is a networking protocol and software program used to access remote computers and terminals over the Internet or a TCP/IP computer network. Telnet was designed for remote server access, 
management and client/server architectures, Telnet works through a purpose-built program that provides connectivity between a remote server and host computer. Since Telnet sends all 
messages in clear text and has no specific security mechanisms, thus in many applications and services, Telnet has been replaced by Secure Shell (SSH).
</div>
<div id="html">
<h2>HTML</h2>
</div>
<div id="html-p">
Hypertext markup language (HTML) is the markup language used to display Web pages on the Internet. "Hypertext" refers to the hyperlinks that an HTML page may contain. "Markup language" refers 
to the way tags are used to define the page layout and elements within the page. Web pages are composed of HTML, which is used to display text, images or other resources through a Web browser. 
All HTML is plain text, meaning it is not compiled and may be read by humans. The file extension for an HTML file is .htm or .html.
</div>
<div id="css">
<h2>CSS</h2>
</div>
<div id="css-p">
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a standard that describes the formatting of markup language pages. CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen. It can control the layout of 
multiple web pages all at once. CSS helps Web developers create a uniform look across several pages of a Web site. Instead of defining the style of each table and each block of text within a 
page's HTML, commonly used styles need to be defined only once in a CSS document. Once the style is defined in cascading style sheet, it can be used by any page that references the CSS file. 
External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.

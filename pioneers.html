Douglas Engelbart was an American engineer and inventor, and an early computer and Internet pioneer. He is best known for his work on founding the 
field of human–computer interaction, particularly while at his Augmentation Research Center Lab in SRI International, which resulted in creation of
the computer mouse, and the development of hypertext, networked computers, and precursors to graphical user interfaces. In 1968, Engelbart and his 
team presented the NLS at a computer conference in a demonstration that quickly became known as “The Mother of All Demos.” In 1969 they became the 
second host on the ARPAnet, exchanging first transmissions with UCLA.  A year later, Engelbart wrote “Intellectual Implications of Multi-Access 
Computer Networks,” in which he foretold the emergence of a new “marketplace” representing “fantastic wealth in commodities of knowledge, service, 
information, processing, and storage,”  with “a vitality and dynamism as much greater than today’s as today’s is greater than the village market.” 
Engelbart also founded ARPAnet’s Network Information Center.

Theodor Holm Nelson is an American pioneer of information technology, philosopher and sociologist. He coined the terms hypertext and hypermedia in 1963 
and published them in 1965. Nelson founded Project Xanadu in 1960, with the goal of creating a computer network with a simple user interface. As conceived 
by Nelson, Xanadu is to be a multi-dimensional system for accessing, indexing, and preserving the world's vast stores of art and literature, with works 
available easily and perpetually, with the easy ability to "transclude" portions of documents, and with automatic micro-royalties assessed on every byte 
transmitted.

<div id="info3">
Steve Jobs was an American inventor, designer and entrepreneur who was the co-founder, chief executive and chairman of Apple Computer. Apple's revolutionary 
products, which include the iPod, iPhone and iPad, are now seen as dictating the evolution of modern technology. In 1976, Jobs along with Steve Wozniak 
started Apple Computer in the Jobs’ family garage and in same year Apple I computer was designed and developed. In 1977, Jobs and Wozniak introduced the Apple II 
at the West Coast Computer Faire. In 1984, Apple introduced Macintosh, the first mass-produced computer with a GUI. After leaving Apple in 1985, Jobs began a new 
hardware and software enterprise called NeXT, Inc. In 1997, Jobs returned to his post as Apple's CEO.

<div id="info4">
Tim Berners-Lee is an English engineer and computer scientist, best known as the inventor of the World Wide Web. He made a proposal for an information management 
system in March 1989, and he implemented the first successful communication between a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) client and server via the Internet.
In 1994, Berners-Lee founded the World Wide Web (W3C) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In 2012 he co-founded the Open Data Institute (ODI) which 
advocates for Open Data in the UK and globally.

<div id="info5">
Marc Andreessen is an American entrepreneur, investor, and software engineer. He is the co-author of Mosaic, the first widely used Web browser and co-fonder of Netscape.
As an undergraduate at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, he worked at the university’s National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA), where he 
became familiar with Tim Berners-Lee’s open standards for the World Wide Web. He and a co-worker, Eric Bina, created a user-friendly browser with integrated graphics 
that would work on a wide range of computers. The resulting code was the Mosaic Web browser, and Andreessen and Bina left NCSA to found Netscape.

<div id="info6">
Rob Hartill is a computer programmer and web designer best known for his work on the Internet Movie Database (IMDb) website. Rob was involved in the development of 
Apache web server. He wrote the Cardiff Internet Movie Database interface in 1993. Rob played a key role in the initial growth of the World Wide Web. In 1994, he 
co-founded the Apache Software Foundation and made numerous contributions to the Apache HTTP (web) server. From 1996 until the time of writing, the Apache web server 
was responsible for serving more web sites than any other server and, for much of this period, was responsible for serving more sites than all other web servers combined.

<div id="info7">
Lou Montulli is a computer programmer known for his work in producing web browsers. In 1991 and 1992, while he was in University of Kansas, Lou co-authored a text 
web browser called Lynx, with Michael Grobe and Charles Rezac. This web browser was one of the first available and is still in use today. In 1994 he became a founding 
engineer of Netscape Communications programmed the networking code for the first versions of the Netscape web browser. Lou helped in creation of server push and client pull,
HTTP proxying, HTTP cookies, the blink tag, and encouraged the implementation of animated GIFs into the browser.

Vint Cerf is widely "Father of the Internet", Cerf is the co-designer of the TCP/IP protocols and the architecture of the Internet. Cerf start his work at the United States 
Department of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). He played a key role in  leading the development of Internet and Internet-related data packet and security 
technologies. Between 2000-2007, Vint Cerf served as chairman of the board of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN).Cerf has worked for Google as 
a Vice President and Chief Internet Evangelist since October 2005.

<div id="info9">
Robert Elliot Kahn is an American electrical engineer, who, along with Vint Cerf invented the TCP/IP protocols, the fundamental communication protocols at the heart of the Internet.
Kahn was responsible for originating DARPA’s Internet program.  Kahn demonstrated the ARPNET by connecting 20 different computers at the International Computer Communication 
Conference. It was then that people realized the importance of packet switching technology. While working on the SATNET satellite packet network project, he came up with an idea 
of TCP which was replacement of earlier network protocol, NCP, used in the ARPANET. TCP played a major role in forming the basis of open-architecture networking, which would allow 
computers and networks all over the world to communicate with each other, regardless of what hardware or software the computers on each network used.

<h3>Vannevar Bush, D.Eng.</h3>

<div id="info10">
Vannevar Bush was American engineer, inventor and science administrator, who during World War II headed the U.S. Office of Scientific Research 
and Development (OSRD).Between 1927 and 1943 Bush developed a series of electromechanical analog computers which greatly facilitated the solution 
of complex mathematical problems. Notably in 1931, with Frank D. Gage, Harold L. Hazen, King E. Gould, and Samuel H. Caldwell, Bush completed the 
Differential Analyzer. It could solve sixth-order differential equations and three simultaneous second-order differential equations. Vannevar Bush 
was never directly involved with the creation or development of the Internet. He died before the creation of the World Wide Web. Yet many consider 
Bush to be the Godfather of our wired age often making reference to his 1945 essay, "As We May Think." In his article, Bush described a theoretical
machine he called a "memex," which was to enhance human memory by allowing the user to store and retrieve documents linked by associations. This 
associative linking was very similar to what is known today as hypertext.

To view a web page on internet, you need to request that page from a web server. When you type a URL into your browser, for example https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_text_text-decoration.asp ,
your browser requests the page from the web server and the web server sends the page back.
This process happens in following steps:
<div class="step">
<h2>Browser Resolves the Domain Name to an IP Address</h2>
</div>
Your web browser first need to know the domain name www.w3schools.com resolves to which IP address. If the web browser does not have this information stored in it's cache, it requests the information 
from one or more DNS servers via the internet. The 	DNS server tells the browser which IP address the domain name resolves to and therefore, where the website is located.
<div class="step">
<h2>Browser Requests the Full URL</h2>
</div>
Now the web browser knows which IP address the website is located at, it can request the full URL from the web server.
<div class="step">
<h2>Web Server sends the Requested Page</h2>
</div>
The web server responds by sending back the requested page. If the page does not exists or another error occurs, then web server will send back the appropriate error message.
<div class="step">
<h2>Browser Displays the Webpage</h2>
</div>
Your web browser receives the page and renders it as required.

<h2>Origins</h2>
</div>
<div class="p-origins">
In August 1962, J.C.R. Licklider at M.I.T. first elucidated his dream of a "Galactic Network". He envisioned a globally interconnected set of computers through which 
everyone could quickly access data, programs and other such documents from any site.  In spirit, the concept was very much  like the Internet of today. The first major
break-through in this direction was the packet-switching theory proposed by Leonard Kleinrock published in a paper in 1964. This theory was later implemented in the 
ARPANET, which is considered as the predecessor of the modern day internet. The internet as we know today is a gigantic hardware network of interconnected media devices.
The largest content accessible through this internet is World Wide Web.

<h3>Internet</h3>
</div>
<div class="int">
The internet or net  is a worldwide system of computer networks -- a network of networks in which users at any one computer can, if they have permission, get information 
from any other computer. It was conceived by the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) of the U.S. government in 1969 and was first known as the ARPANet. No single 
authority owns or controls the internet. No single set of laws governs its content.
</div>
<div class="www">
<h3>World Wide Web</h3>
</div>
<div class="w">
The World Wide Web is combination of all resources and users on the Internet that are using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol. The massive content on World Wide Web is accessible
by connecting your media device in the form of digital data, images, documents, videos, articles and other forms of digital data as well. The web is the mass of HTML pages and 
images that travel through the internet's hardware. You may hear the expressions "Web 1.0", "Web 2.0" and the "Invisible Web" to describe these billions of webpages.

</div>
<div class="p-telnet">
Telnet stands for Teletype Network, was developed in 1969, is a protocol that provides a command line interface for communication with a remote device or server, sometimes employed
for remote management but also for initial device setup like network hardware.
</div>
<div class="ssh">
SSH
</div>
<div class="p-ssh">
SSH, also known as Secure Shell or Secure Socket Shell, is a network protocol that gives users, particularly system administrators, a secure way to access a computer over an unsecured network.
SSH also refers to the suite of utilities that implement the SSH protocol. Secure Shell provides strong authentication and encrypted data communications between two computers connecting over an
open network such as the internet.
</div>
<div class="ftp">
FTP
</div>
<div class="p-ftp">
FTP stands for "File Transfer Protocol." FTP is a protocol designed for transferring files over the Internet. Files stored on an FTP server can be accessed using an FTP client, such as a web browser,
FTP software program, or a command line interface.
</div>
<div class="http">
HTTP
</div>
<div class="p-http">
HTTP means "HyperText Transfer Protocol". HTTP is the underlying protocol used by the World Wide Web and this protocol defines how messages are formatted and transmitted, and what actions Web servers
and browsers should take in response to various commands.
</div>
<div class="gopher">
Gopher
</div>
<div class="p-gopher">
Gopher is an application-layer protocol designed for distributing, searching, and retrieving documents in Internet Protocol networks. Gopher is mostly text based and while it does have some multimedia 
support in the form of images, it lacks many of the features present in the modern equivalent, http/html.
</div>
<div class="browser">
Browser
</div>
<div class="p-browser">
Browser alternatively known as web browser or Internet browser is a software program to present and explore content on the World Wide Web. These pieces of content, including pictures, videos, and web

<div class="lynx">
Lynx
</div>
<div class="p-lynx">
Lynx is text-only web browser originally designed to run on UNIX, but today it also runs on other platforms such as Linux, MacOS, VMS. Lynx was developed by students and staff at University of Kansas
in 1992 for distributing information on a campus-wide information system and as a Gopher client, but it quickly became popular with visually impaired users because of its text-to-speech friendly interface.
</div>
<div class="mosaic">
Mosaic
</div>
<div class="p-mosaic">
Mosaic, originally known as NCSA page was the first popular Web browser, which greatly helped spread use and knowledge of the web across the world. It was also a client for earlier internet protocols such
as File Transfer Protocol, Network News Transfer Protocol, and Gopher.
</div>
<div class="hypertext">
Hypertext
</div>
<div class="p-hypertext">
Hypertext is text which contains links known as hyperlinks which are connected to other texts that reader can access immediately. Through the use of textual links, Web pages written in HyperText Markup
